# Udacity React Nanodegree Project: Mobile Flashcards
This is the third project from the Udacity React Nanodegree and focuses on building a "Mobile Flashcards" app using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, clone this repository and run the following commands:
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`
   - Since this project is `React Native` and iOS and/or Android Simulator will need to be configured on the computer.

## Application Overview
The app helps users study by allowing them to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. The specific requirements provided by Udacity for the project were:

- Use create-react-native-app to build your project.
- Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
- Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
- The front of the card should display the question.
- The back of the card should display the answer.
- Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
- Users should receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.
